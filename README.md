# Lean Program Verification: Spring Physics Example

A formal verification project demonstrating the use of Lean 4 for mathematical and software verification, starting with classical spring physics as a foundational example.

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository showcases formal program verification using Lean 4's theorem proving capabilities. It demonstrates how to:

- **Formally define** mathematical concepts (spring force, potential energy)
- **Prove theorems** about physical relationships (F = -dU/dx)
- **Verify computational correctness** through both formal proofs and numerical validation
- **Structure Lean projects** for scientific computing verification

## üî¨ Scientific Background

The project verifies fundamental relationships in spring physics:

- **Hooke's Law**: F(x) = -kx (force proportional to displacement)
- **Potential Energy**: U(x) = (k/2)x¬≤ (quadratic energy function)
- **Energy-Force Relationship**: F(x) = -dU/dx (force as negative energy gradient)

## üî¨ Verification Approach

The project demonstrates two complementary verification strategies:

### **1. Formal Mathematical Proofs**
- Propositions defined for all physical relationships
- Theorems proven using Lean's proof engine
- Type-checked mathematical consistency
- Zero tolerance for logical errors

### **2. Computational Verification**
- Numerical validation at specific test points
- Approximate derivative calculations
- Floating-point arithmetic verification
- Practical confidence building

## üìä Results

The verification establishes:

- ‚úÖ **Force Definition Correctness**: F(x) = -kx is properly implemented
- ‚úÖ **Energy Definition Correctness**: U(x) = (k/2)x¬≤ is properly implemented  
- ‚úÖ **Equilibrium Properties**: Both F(0) = 0 and U(0) = 0 are proven
- ‚úÖ **Numerical Verification**: F = -dU/dx relationship confirmed computationally
- ‚úÖ **Linearity Properties**: Force linearity and energy scaling proven (with axioms)

Sample output:
```
