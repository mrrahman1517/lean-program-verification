# Lean Program Verification: Spring Physics Example

A formal verification project demonstrating the use of Lean 4 for mathematical and software verification, starting with classical spring physics as a foundational example.

## üéØ Project Overview

This repository showcases formal program verification using Lean 4's theorem proving capabilities. It demonstrates how to:

- **Formally define** mathematical concepts (spring force, potential energy)
- **Prove theorems** about physical relationships (F = -dU/dx)
- **Verify computational correctness** through both formal proofs and numerical validation
- **Structure Lean projects** for scientific computing verification

## üî¨ Scientific Background

The project verifies fundamental relationships in spring physics:

- **Hooke's Law**: F(x) = -kx (force proportional to displacement)
- **Potential Energy**: U(x) = (k/2)x¬≤ (quadratic energy function)
- **Energy-Force Relationship**: F(x) = -dU/dx (force as negative energy gradient)

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Lean 4** and elan (version manager):
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **VS Code Setup** (recommended):
   - Install the "Lean 4" extension for syntax highlighting and interactive theorem proving

### Building and Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mrrahman1517/lean-program-verification.git
cd lean-program-verification/SpringPhysics

# Build the project
lake build

# Run existing programs
lake exe rigorous        # Main verification program
lake exe helloworld     # Hello world example
lake exe test_factorial  # Factorial computation example
```

## üéÆ Running Any Lean File

This project includes several convenient methods to run any Lean file:

### **Method 1: Direct Execution (Simplest)**
```bash
lean --run filename.lean    # Works for any .lean file with main function
```

### **Method 2: Using Helper Scripts**

The project includes several utility scripts to make development easier:

```bash
# Run any existing Lean file
./run_lean.sh filename.lean

# Create a new Lean file from template and run it
./new_lean.sh myprogram    # Creates myprogram.lean and runs it

# Add an existing Lean file as a permanent executable to lakefile.lean
./add_executable.sh myprogram    # Adds myprogram to build system
```

### **Method 3: Manual Lake Configuration**

To permanently add a new executable to the project:

1. Edit `lakefile.lean` and add:
   ```lean
   lean_exe ¬´your_program_name¬ª where
     root := `your_program_name
   ```

2. Build and run:
   ```bash
   lake build your_program_name
   lake exe your_program_name
   ```

### **Creating New Lean Programs**

Any Lean file with a `main` function can be executed. Here's a template:

```lean
def main : IO Unit := do
  IO.println "Hello from Lean!"
  -- Add your code here
```

### **Available Utility Scripts**

- **`run_lean.sh`**: Simple wrapper for `lean --run` with error checking
- **`new_lean.sh`**: Create new Lean file from template and run immediately  
- **`add_executable.sh`**: Add existing file to lakefile for permanent builds
- **`add_and_run.sh`**: Combine adding to lakefile and running (experimental)

## üéì Educational Value

This project serves as an educational example of:

### **Formal Verification Concepts**
- Mathematical definitions in type theory
- Theorem proving with tactics
- Computational verification vs formal proof
- Integration of symbolic and numerical methods

## üî¨ Verification Approach

The project demonstrates two complementary verification strategies:

### **1. Formal Mathematical Proofs**
- Propositions defined for all physical relationships
- Theorems proven using Lean's proof engine
- Type-checked mathematical consistency
- Zero tolerance for logical errors

### **2. Computational Verification**
- Numerical validation at specific test points
- Approximate derivative calculations
- Floating-point arithmetic verification
- Practical confidence building

## üìä Results

The verification establishes:

- ‚úÖ **Force Definition Correctness**: F(x) = -kx is properly implemented
- ‚úÖ **Energy Definition Correctness**: U(x) = (k/2)x¬≤ is properly implemented  
- ‚úÖ **Equilibrium Properties**: Both F(0) = 0 and U(0) = 0 are proven
- ‚úÖ **Numerical Verification**: F = -dU/dx relationship confirmed computationally
- ‚úÖ **Linearity Properties**: Force linearity and energy scaling proven (with axioms)

Sample output:
```
